#  Text Summarization App

+ **Model Name**: T5-4-Summarization
+ **Architecture**: Encoder-Decoder (T5)

## Model Description
T5-4-Summarization is a fine-tuned version of the T5 model designed for the task of text summarization. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a versatile encoder-decoder model that can handle a wide range of text generation tasks by converting them into a text-to-text format. It has been pre-trained on a variety of tasks, including supervised and self-supervised training.

## Features
+ **Model**: T5-4-Summarization, a fine-tuned T5 model for text summarization tasks. [**https://huggingface.co/ayoubkirouane/T5-4-Summarization**]
+ **Interface**: Gradio interface for user interaction.
+ **Input**: Users can input text documents or articles they want to summarize.
+ **Output**: The app generates abstractive summaries of the input text.

## Dataset
+ **Dataset Used**: The model was fine-tuned on the news_summary dataset, but it can be generalized.
+ **Dataset Description**: The news_summary dataset consists of news articles along with their corresponding human-written summaries. It is commonly used for abstractive summarization tasks

## Use Cases
T5-4-Summarization can be utilized in various natural language processing tasks and applications, including but not limited to:

+ **Text Summarization**: Automatically generating concise and coherent summaries of long documents or articles.
+ **Content Curation**: Curating content for blogs, news websites, and other platforms by providing brief summaries of articles.
+ **Information Extraction**: Extracting key information and insights from large volumes of text data.
+ **Document Classification**: Enhancing document classification by summarizing documents for better categorization.

## Limitations
+ **Data Bias**: The quality of the generated summaries is highly dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data. Biases present in the training data may also be reflected in the generated summaries.
+ **Abstractive Summaries**: While T5-4-Summarization can generate abstractive summaries that capture the essence of the input text, it may occasionally produce summaries that are factually incorrect or biased.
+ **Length Constraints**: The model may have limitations in handling very long documents or producing extremely concise summaries.
+ **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: The model may not perform well on highly specialized or domain-specific texts if not fine-tuned on relevant data.

## Getting Started with the Model : 

```python
# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("summarization", model="ayoubkirouane/T5-4-Summarization")

text = """
put the text you want to summarize here .
"""

pipe(text)[0]["summary_text"]

```

# Getting Started with the APP : 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
